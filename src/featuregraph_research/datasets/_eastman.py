    Parameters
    ----------
    dataset:
        ``"faulty_training"`` for a selected fault run or
        ``"faultfree_training"`` for the normal-operation training
        workbook. ``"fault_free_training"`` is accepted as an alias.

    fault_number:
        Fault identifier for ``faulty_training``. It is accepted but
        ignored for ``faultfree_training``; fault-free rows are labeled
        with fault number zero.

    simulation_run:
        Simulation-run identifier added to the returned frame.

    refresh:
        Redownload the source workbook even when it is cached.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
        Industrial process observations with standardized FeatureGraph
        column names.
